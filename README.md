Goal for this repo is to have an auto setup for my linux env. If I reimage a pc or work on a vm, I want my env to be there an not have to reconfigure by scratch. 

For the near future I'm going to use github abnormally. I've had trouble commiting to the process of moving to linux to emerese myself and get to know the system better. 
Having an updating a repo, even if incorrecly will help motivate me to work more at programing and playing with linux

If you are viewing the github, hello random person on the internet. I hope you have found happiness in life and if you are on the way there, I hope your path is smooth and quick. If anyone has any advice or can think of anything they want to share, I'd be honored to hear it. This is a random readme on a random account, so thanks for any feedback. if I ever get any I'll drop this line but, off you go, you message in bottle of a readme lol.
